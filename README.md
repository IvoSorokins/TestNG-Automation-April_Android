## Utils:

### ScreenshotUtil:
- Utility class for capturing screenshots.
- Provides a method for capturing screenshots based on test status.

### TestListener
- TestNG listener class responsible for capturing screenshots on test success and failure.
- Implements ITestListener interface.

### Helpers
- Utility class containing helper methods for actions with elements.

### DriverSetup
- Utility class for setting up and tearing down the Appium Driver before and after test execution.
- Initializes the driver and performs necessary configurations.
#### Appium Capabilities
- `Platform` : Specifies the platform on which the tests will run. In this case, it's set to Android.

- `DEVICE_NAME_OPTION` : Defines the name of the device to be used for testing. This can be configured based on the device connected or the emulator being used.

- `UDID_OPTION` : Specifies the unique device identifier (UDID) of the device to be used for testing. This is particularly useful when testing on real devices.

- `AUTOMATION_NAME_OPTION` : Sets the name of the automation framework to be used. For Android, it's typically set to UiAutomator2.

- `APP_OPTION` : Specifies the path to the application (.apk) file to be installed on the device/emulator for testing.

- `APP_ACTIVITY_OPTION` : Defines the main activity of the Android application to start from. This is required to launch the application on the device.

- `APP_PACKAGE_OPTION` : Specifies the package name of the Android application. This is necessary to identify the application uniquely on the device.

- `NO_RESET_OPTION` : When set to true, it clears the app data and cache before running each test, ensuring a clean state.

- `FULL_RESET_OPTION` : When set to true, it uninstalls the existing version of the app from the device and installs the new version specified in the APP_OPTION.

- `AUTO_GRANT_PERMISSIONS_OPTION` : Automatically grants permissions requested by the app during the test execution. This is particularly useful for granting permissions like location, camera, etc., without user interaction.

- `disableIdLocatorAutocompletion` : Disables autocompletion for ID locator strategy in Appium. This can help in preventing unexpected behavior while locating elements.

- `skipDeviceInitialization` : This capability, when set to true, skips the initialization phase for the device, which can speed up test execution by avoiding unnecessary device setup steps.

### Global Variables
- Contains global variables used across the project.

### ConfigReader
- Utility class for reading configuration properties.
- Provides a method for retrieving properties from config.properties.
